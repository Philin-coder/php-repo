# Book Store Bootstrap 4 Template

## What is this?
This is a Bootstrap 4 template.

In the demo at the end of this Readme you can try the HTML version. I have also created a branch for the WordPress version but it is not finished yet, since I have to finish creating all the pages of the HTML version to have a fully working theme on WordPress. But it will be ready soon!

## Why have I done this?
I did this just because I was bored and I was thinking about doing something like this. I am thinking maybe in the future create a extension of this template, I mean a template with more pages like a blog page, post page, categories page, profile page, contact page... So what can I say, stay tuned, I am sure this repo will be updated with a more complex template soon.

## What is the future of this?
As I said, I will be improving this, adding more pages to make it a full template. For now, this is my ToDo list:
- [x] Basic Template
- [x] Mobile Friendly
- [ ] Add Blog Page
- [ ] Add Post Page
- [ ] Add Profile Page
- [ ] Add Contact Page
- [ ] Add General Page
- [ ] Add General Error Page
- [ ] Add Error 404 Page
- [ ] Add Error 500 Page
- [ ] Add Login Page
- [ ] Add Register Page
- [ ] Add Recover Password Page
- [ ] Finish transforming it into a fully working WordPress theme
*Do you think I should add any other (I think maybe I forgot some important page)? Just post an issue!*

## What external resources does it use?
Bootstrap 4 libraries (including jQuery, not the slim version since we use the .animate() function), FontAwesome 4 free and some Google Fonts.

## Demo? I need a demo!
Of course! If you want to check how it looks, check the demo [here](https://naucode.github.io/Book-Store-Bootstrap-4-Template/).
